7,1) Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.
8,"2) Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks. For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone."
9,"3) It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack."
10,"4) Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription. You can stream in Amazon prime video, music from prime music, become an Amazon prime member, free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only."
11,"5) You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips, Xiaomi, Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devices."
12,"1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant, Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)"
13,"2) It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered (same is the case with Google home)"
14,"So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with, Google home is your choice. For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better."

18," In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that's where it stops."
19,"Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. "
20,Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now
21,It’s jus beyond awesome.?????????? I thought dot is bit small so the sound quality may affect due to size but really it’s really a beast
22,. The sound system is jus beyond my expectations in one room the sound to the full volume is very loud.
23,sure if it searched in google engine and find answers to all your query. Part sound quality is just awesome...you do not need a speaker to connect.
24, Looks wise an excellent one. I am fan of it now
25,"all over your home, they weren't the most attractive devices and had weedy sounds. "
26,"Bought it on tha second day of Prime day in a combo -The Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) as a vast improvement on the originals, even though it costs exactly the same"
